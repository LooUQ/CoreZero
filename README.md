## Core Library

The LooUQ IoT Core library provides a framework that allows rapid development of cross-platform solutions. The library is object-oriented and reactive, providing the
developer with powerful tools. The library is written in C++11 without using the STL (due to the lack of support on the Arduino Platform). The library primarily relies
on the C99 library, maintaining portability. Fundamental templated object are implemented in this library, compiling on both Arduino and Windows alike.
